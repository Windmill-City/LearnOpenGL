## Encoding

### Glossary

| Word      | Meaning                                      | Example               |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Codepoint | Numerical value maps to a specific character | \u0000                |
| Codepage  | Collection of codepoints                     | GBK; GB2312; Unicode; |
| Encoding  | Codepoint format in bytes                    | UTF-8; UTF-16; ANSI;  |
---

Following table shows the encoding of the strings depends on their physical location:

| Physical Location | Encoding |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| Disk              | UTF-8    |
| Memory(Windows)   | UTF-16   |
| Memory(Linux)     | UTF-32   |

Note: Encoding here is **NOT** regulated by any standard! This regulation only suits in **MY** program!

Following table shows the encoding of the strings depends on their storage class:

| Class                 | Encoding |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| std::string           | UTF-8    |
| std::wstring(Windows) | UTF-16   |
| std::wstring(Linux)   | UTF-32   |
| std::u8string         | UTF-8    |
| std::u16string        | UTF-16   |
| std::u32string        | UTF-32   |

Note: Encoding here is **NOT** regulated by any standard! This regulation only suits in **MY** program!

Before passing strings through OS-dependent APIs, we need to set the correct locale to ensure that the correct codepage and encoding method are used. The following code sets the active codepage to Unicode and the encoding method to `UTF-8`.

```c++
setlocale(LC_ALL, ".UTF-8");
```

Then the locale-dependent functions, such as `mbstowcs`; `wcstombs`, will return properly translated strings. The strings passed to the OS-dependent APIs will properly translated. (On Windows, these are the ANSI APIs.)

Note: Remember to set the encoding for the compiler, for example, use `/utf8` for MSVC.

### std::locale::global

The following code is **Needless** to call, as its default value is `C`, which means it will use the locale set by `setlocale` for C environment.

```c++
std::locale::global(std::locale(".UTF-8"));
```

### Details

Take Windows for excample, its API has two encoding versions, one uses the ANSI encoding, and the other uses the `Unicode` codepage and `UTF-16` encoding.

#### ANSI

ANSI is an encoding method that regulates the conversion of codepoints to bytes and vice versa. To identify a specific character using its codepoints, it is necessary to know the codepage being used.

Language specific codepages:
| Codepage | Language            |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| GB2312   | Simplified Chinese  |
| GBK      | Simplified Chinese  |
| GB18030  | Simplified Chinese  |
| Big5     | Traditional Chinese |
| S-JIS    | Japanese            |

```c++
setlocale(LC_ALL, ".UTF-8");
```

The code above actually sets the codepage the ANSI API uses.

#### Unicode

ANSI uses same encoding method across different codepages, while Unicode has unique codepage but has different encodings.

Encodings:
| Encoding      | Length   | Range                 | Codepoint Size(Byte) |
| ------------- | -------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| UTF-8         | Variable | Full Unicode Codepage | 1 ~ 6                |
| UCS-2         | Fixed    | \u0000 ~ \uFFFF       | 2                    |
| UTF-16        | Variable | Full Unicode Codepage | 2 / 4                |
| UTF-32(UCS-4) | Fixed    | Full Unicode Codepage | 4                    |

The default codepage and encoding method depend on the userâ€™s settings, which means they can vary. If a fixed codepage and encoding method are not set, it is necessary to perform complicated codepage and encoding conversions every time, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.

### Why not UTF-8 in memory

Using a fixed-length encoding can make string operations faster and simpler without the complexity of dealing with variable-length encodings.

    Note over S: Shader Init
    S -->>+F: ResourceLocation

    par Async

        O -->> F: Cache
        deactivate F
    end

    O ->> P: Link
    deactivate O

    P ->>+ S: ProgramId

    Note over S: Use Shader
